# From the Big Apple to the Field of Dreams - Bike Sharing in Des Moines
## Overview
Bike sharing is like pizza in New York: You have to have it. But does it work in Des Moines. Our firm wants you to know that this is sustainable at the right price and implementation. We have learned this business on a large scale in order to control costs in a much smaller universt, while also learning our customer's needs.

## Results of the NYC Analysis in Summary
### Checkout Times by User
![image of Checkout times](https://github.com/jraguDataGuy/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Times%20-%20Users.png)
Our users seem to prefer short trips. The downtown Des Moines area would benefit from having our bikes for short trips to the different shops and attractions. 

### Check Times by Gender

Currently, New York customers are predominately men. 

### Trips by Weekday by Hour

We see the typical work week commute times as the highest demanded times as expected

### Trips by Gender (Weekday by Hour)

Similar to our trips data prior, men regularly travel on our bikes. 

### Customers vs Subscribers

Our Male subscriber base helps our numbers during the work week

### Additional Vizualizations for Thought
In an analysis of the New York territory, we did see the downtown area as our highest volume of start location. Given the tourist and worker co-demand, this was not much of a surprise:

However, our subscriber base was less concentrated in the downtown areas. This seems like an opportunity to try to retain customers in this territory long term:

## Conclusion/Additional Analysis
The model is prove in New York. We would need to look into a few more items/visualizations to help make conclusions for Des Moines:
- Is Des Moines' downtown area mainly for workers or visitors. If it is for visitors, I would want to review the weekend trips by duration to see if there was a smart plan for the city to charge a weekend pass for the bikes to encourage use without being cost restrictive
- A deeper dive in subscriber data is needed. The subscriber market feels like the place for a smaller city. How many rides are subcribers taking, and what can we conclude as an appropriate cost per ride/cost per distance?

A worker-targeted strategy could work for Des Moines if workers needed bikes to get from point a to b.
